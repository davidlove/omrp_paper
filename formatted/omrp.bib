  Abstract                 = {For a steady-state simulation output process, we formulate efficient algorithms to compute certain estimators of the process variance parameter (i.e., the sum of covariances at all lags), where the estimators are derived in principle from overlapping batches separately and then averaged over all such batches. The algorithms require order-of-sample-size work to evaluate overlapping versions of the area and Cramer-von Mises estimators arising in the method of standardized time series. Recently, Alexopoulos et al. showed that, compared with estimators based on nonoverlapping batches, the estimators based on overlapping batches achieve reduced variance while maintaining similar bias asymptotically as the batch size increases. We provide illustrative analytical and Monte Carlo results for M/M/1 queue waiting times and for a first-order autoregressive process. We also present evidence that the asymptotic distribution of each overlapping variance estimator can be closely approximated using an appropriately rescaled chi-squared random variable with matching mean and variance.}

  Abstract                 = {To estimate the variance parameter (i.e., the sum of covariances at all lags) for a steady-state simulation output process, we formulate certain statistics that are computed from overlapping batches separately and then averaged over all such batches. We form overlapping versions of the area and Cramer-von Mises estimators using the method of standardized time series. For these estimators, we establish (i) their limiting distributions as the sample size increases while the ratio of the sample size to the batch size remains fixed; and (ii) their mean-square convergence to the variance parameter as both the batch size and the ratio of the sample size to the batch size increase. Compared with their counterparts computed from nonoverlapping batches, the estimators computed from overlapping batches asymptotically achieve reduced variance while maintaining the same bias as the sample size increases; moreover, the new variance estimators usually achieve similar improvements compared with the conventional variance estimators based on nonoverlapping or overlapping batch means. In follow-up work, we present several analytical and Monte Carlo examples, and we formulate efficient procedures for computing the overlapping estimators with only order-of-sample-size effort.}
