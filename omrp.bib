  title = {Efficient computation of overlapping variance estimators for simulation},

  number = {3},
  abstract = {For a steady-state simulation output process, we formulate efficient
	algorithms to compute certain estimators of the process variance
	parameter (i.e., the sum of covariances at all lags), where the estimators
	are derived in principle from overlapping batches separately and
	then averaged over all such batches. The algorithms require order-of-sample-size
	work to evaluate overlapping versions of the area and Cramer-von
	Mises estimators arising in the method of standardized time series.
	Recently, Alexopoulos et al. showed that, compared with estimators
	based on nonoverlapping batches, the estimators based on overlapping
	batches achieve reduced variance while maintaining similar bias asymptotically
	as the batch size increases. We provide illustrative analytical and
	Monte Carlo results for M/M/1 queue waiting times and for a first-order
	autoregressive process. We also present evidence that the asymptotic
	distribution of each overlapping variance estimator can be closely
	approximated using an appropriately rescaled chi-squared random variable
	with matching mean and variance.},

  abstract = {To estimate the variance parameter (i.e., the sum of covariances at
	all lags) for a steady-state simulation output process, we formulate
	certain statistics that are computed from overlapping batches separately
	and then averaged over all such batches. We form overlapping versions
	of the area and Cramer-von Mises estimators using the method of standardized
	time series. For these estimators, we establish (i) their limiting
	distributions as the sample size increases while the ratio of the
	sample size to the batch size remains fixed; and (ii) their mean-square
	convergence to the variance parameter as both the batch size and
	the ratio of the sample size to the batch size increase. Compared
	with their counterparts computed from nonoverlapping batches, the
	estimators computed from overlapping batches asymptotically achieve
	reduced variance while maintaining the same bias as the sample size
	increases; moreover, the new variance estimators usually achieve
	similar improvements compared with the conventional variance estimators
	based on nonoverlapping or overlapping batch means. In follow-up
	work, we present several analytical and Monte Carlo examples, and
	we formulate efficient procedures for computing the overlapping estimators
	with only order-of-sample-size effort.},
